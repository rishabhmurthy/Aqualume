# Aqualume

Aqualume is a user-friendly mobile application created to retrieve, store, and analyze water quality data. This application acts as a data entry and data retrieval interface application, which enables data collection from a variety of community members and volunteers. The application consists of four sections: Weather, Form, Map, and Data.


##  Project Description

Aqualume helps users analyze water bodies and related resources. Users reduce the quality of water and can view the condition of the water and the temperature in the sample location. The water bodies' and resources' condition can also be analyzed through data over a specific time period. The collected data can be used to promote responsible environmental actions in the user's community.

### 🔹 Weather  
Provides the user with data about the **temperature** of their specified area in real time. Temperature is an important water quality indicator and can help users understand the current environmental condition.

### 🔹 Form  
Allows users to submit water quality observations directly to **Firebase**. The form collects:
- Salinity  
- Water temperature  
- Presence of animals  

This simple and guided interface makes it easy for anyone to contribute valuable environmental data.

### 🔹 Map  
Provides an interactive map with multiple markers, each representing a different collection sample. The map is a great geographical visualization of the data, even though it currently does not provide information about trends.

### 🔹 Data  
Provides quick and easy access to water quality information over a specific period of time from a user's closest area. This research is not focused on trends but is instead aimed at providing information to the users. This helps them understand the sample data.



##  How to Use Aqualume

### 1. **Open the app**
Navigate through the bottom navigation bar to explore the four main sections.

### 2. **Check the Weather tab**
View the current temperature for environmental context before collecting samples.

### 3. **Submit an observation using the Form**
Fill in salinity, temperature, and animal presence, then submit. Your data will be saved to Firebase and added to the community dataset.

### 4. **Explore sampling locations on the Map**
View sample points added by other users. Tap markers to learn where data has been collected.

### 5. **View local water data in the Data tab**
See the latest observations taken in your nearby region to understand current water quality conditions.
